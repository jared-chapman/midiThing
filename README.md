# midiThing

## Setup
1. Connect any midi devices you might want to use to a computer
2. Run `aconnect -l` and note the device names (or get their exact midi device name somewhere else I guess)
3. Edit the `preferredInputs` and `preferredOutputs` arrays to include your devices
4. Do something to run `main.py` on startup (crontab, etc.) so we can throw away all monitors, keyboards, and mice

### Simple mode
Simple mode will try to connect the first available preferred input to the first available preferred output, and will keep trying until it connects. 
If a device is unplugged after it is connected it will no reconnect, so if you have a breadboard and some wire you might enjoy...

### Button mode
Run simple mode every time a button is pressed

### Frenzy mode
Connects every available input to every available output every few seconds. Bad idea? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

### SenseHat mode
Runs simple mode once to try to connect preferred devices, then uses the [Raspberry Pi SenseHat](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2738) to manually make connections.
